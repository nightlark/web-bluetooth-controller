# Placeholder Controller

Note: This is a template repository for creating a web page that controls a BLE enabled device using Web Bluetooth. The general idea (if it works) is that it will be opened in GitHub Copilot Codespaces, which will be given a prompt with information on a device including Services and Characteristics UUIDs and their function in order to quickly stand up a basic page for controlling said devices.

This project provides a web page for controlling Placeholder devices using Web Bluetooth. For more information and to access the web page, please visit the [GitHub Pages site](placeholder url).

To use it you will need a [browser that supports Web Bluetooth](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API), which as of August 2024 is mostly Chrome, Edge, and Opera.
